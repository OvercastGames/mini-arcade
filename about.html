      <p>I've spent most of my career managing a small, independent paint-your-own pottery studio. Over the years I've
        spent more and more of my free time tinkering late at night with command line tools, scripts and programming
        languages. A while back when an opportunity to use these hobbies at work came up I was so excited by the
        challenge and so proud of the results that I realized software development was something I could do well and be
        passionate about. I'm looking for a position were I can work with a team of people that are as curious as I am
        about learning how technologies work and solving problems. I really enjoyed working in customer service and I
        see those skills, of offering support and being empathetic and patient, to be a huge asset working with a team.

      <p>Before beginning my software engineering education at CodeFellows, I was studying to become a Registered Nurse
        at Skagit
        Valley College. I'm adept at coordinating, motivating and working within a team to reach our objective.
        I've always been interesting in computers, and after doing some research, coding really caught
        my interest.. Ideally I'd like to work with a team to design, create, and troubleshoot applications remotely,
        and I'd love the opportunity to develop my skillset further as an active member of a programming team.
        I'm inspired by problem solving and finding solutions, and my previously experience with teamwork in Law
        Enforcement
        help me to understand the value of a well coordinated team.</p>

      <p> Hi, my name is Kevin Stone, I am a United States Navy Veteran with a secret clearance. While serving in the US
        Navy I worked as an Aviation Electronics Technician in the first half of my career, fixing RADAR equipment for
        F-18 jets, and for the second half, I moved into a more supervisory role. While in the Navy I got to hone my
        troubleshooting skills, leadership skills, and team management skills along with an assortment of other skills.
        At the tail end of my career in the Navy I was allowed to take a Microsoft Software and Systems Administration
        course that gave me a technical understanding of how the Azure Cloud works from a systems administration side.
        Although I enjoyed the class, I found myself enjoying writing scripts more than building out just virtual
        machines and networks. After diving more into what software engineers did I figured this would be the perfect
        role for me. The fact that I get to solve real world problems with code is the most rewarding thing.</p>

      <p>I was working on Wind Turbines as a Wind Technician.
        It was mostly my curiosity that was sparked by some of my close friends mentioning for me to look into it.
        For an environment, it's just pretty much anywhere I can learn.
        My previous experience that helps me pretty much helps me in any situation is being very familiar with failure.
        I'm not going to be the smartest guy in the room but I do know how to get back up after a whole days worth of
        work turning out to not be the solution I needed.</p>
